## Background - Parkinson's Disease

- Prevalence - approx. 150,000 in Australia
- Increasing by 4% p/a
- 40% live outside capital cities ([Parkinson's Australia](https://www.parkinsons.org.au/))
- Diagnosis: Still difficult - current standard UPDRS-III
- Variable disease progression
- Symptoms: motor & non-motor
- Non-motor: autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric (mood, cognition, behaviour, thought), sensory & sleep 
- Early warning signs: Loss of smell, sleep disturbances, micrographia, facial & speech changes
- Early diagnosis - sway, finger tapping, EEG

## Our study


## EEG - Aperiodic and periodic components
