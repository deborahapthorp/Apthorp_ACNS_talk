## Background - Parkinson's Disease

-   Prevalence - approx. 150,000 in Australia
-   Increasing by 4% p/a
-   40% live outside capital cities ([Parkinson's Australia](https://www.parkinsons.org.au/))
-   Diagnosis: Still difficult - current standard UPDRS-III
-   Variable disease progression
-   Symptoms: motor & non-motor
-   Non-motor: autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric (mood, cognition, behaviour, thought), sensory & sleep
-   Early warning signs: Loss of smell, sleep disturbances, micrographia, facial & speech changes
-   Early diagnosis - sway, finger tapping, EEG

## Our study

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

-   New England region cohort - data collected at 3 time points in Hunter/New England/Tamworth region (2022-2023 - T1 data used here)

-   Canberra cohort - data collected at The Canberra Hospital (2016-2017)

-   EEG (resting state, Go-NoGo), postural sway, finger tapping, MoCA, NUCOG, MDS-UPDRS-III, mood (depression, anxiety), demographics

## EEG - Aperiodic and periodic components

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Traditionally, EEG frequency data has been analysed in bands (delta, alpha, beta, gamma)

-   However, recent research has focused on separating aperiodic (baseline, 1/f slope) from periodic (frequency) components

-   Aperiodic components turn out to be informative - slope flattens with age, and is steeper in some conditions, including Parkinson's disease
